# HTTP Server

This repo acts as a "learning lab" to build a minimal HTTP server from scratch using low level primitives to better
understand:

- TCP networking
- HTTP request/response parsing
- Concurrency and resource management
- Error handling and failure modes

It's written in Go because it’s low level language and will help to understand networking primitives easier. So it won't
relay on net/http package or external frameworks.
